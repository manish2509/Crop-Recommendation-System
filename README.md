# Crop-Recommendation-System

India is a country that has Agriculture as the backbone of the economy. More than
58% of the population has Agriculture as the primary source of income. There are almost
100-150 million farmers in the mother nation. Seeking the dark part of this sector is that
many face losses due to climatic and soil conditions. Many crops die before harvest due to
scarcity of water and soil nutrients. Here is a project that guides the farmer on what crop to
cultivate based on the forecast report of climate and the present soil conditions. The
climatic condition is identified, moisture content present in the soil is detected and Ph level
of water is also considered for crop recommendation. The sensed data from the sensors are
fed into the machine learning algorithm which suggests a suitable crop for cultivation. The
soil parameters are led into various machine learning for crop recommendation and the best
model with the highest accuracy is considered for the result. Considering this, random forest
algorithm is the most accurate model for crop recommendation. The developed project also
predicts the crop yield that can be produced under given circumstances. The fieldâ€™s harvest
strength can be either poor, good or excellent. Based on the same parameters ie, soil
moisture, ph of water and temperature, the crop yield is estimated. The parameters are led
into random forest algorithm and the data is processed to give the desired output. The 
algorithm of crop yield prediction undergoes the best feature extraction technique using
some mathematical calculation in order to give a great accuracy of output. Both crop
recommendation system and crop yield prediction system work together to give the farmer
a clear picture of farming ahead. The hardware module takes the input from the soil
whereas the software module process it to give the recommendation of crop and prediction
of the crop yield. The developed project takes the uncertainty of weather and soil conditions
and gives the farmer a clear picture of the crop field and the climate.
